# Art in the Stone Age

Though it is not manufactured but naturely formed, it is the earliest evidence of human recognition of pictorial image if not art.

## Paleolithic

40,000 - 9000 BCE

### Africa

### Europe

One of the oldest sculptures ever discovered:

![Human with feline \(lion?\) head, restored view, cave at Hohlenstein-Stadel, Germany, ca. 40,000&#x2013;35,000 BCE. Woolly mammoth ivory, 11 58 &quot; high. Ulmer Museum, Ulm.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

Experts estimate this ivory figure required about 400 hours \(two months\) of skilled work. Below are some other famous sculptures:

![Nude woman \(Venus of Willendorf \), from Willendorf, Austria, ca. 28,000&#x2013;25,000 BCE. Limestone, 4 14 &quot; high. Naturhistorisches Museum, Vienna.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

![head of a woman\(?\), Brassempouy, ca. 25,000&#x2013;20,000 BCE. Ivory. Preserved in the Mus&#xE9;e d&apos;Arch&#xE9;ologie Nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

Also important in Paleolithic art is the over 200 sites of painted caves. Some of the most famouts caves:

Negtive hand prints:

![Spotted horses and negative hand imprints, wall painting in the cave at Pech-Merle, France, ca. 23,000&#x2013; 22,000 BCE. 11&apos; 2&quot; long.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Most animals in Paleolithic are painted in strict profile view. But the bulls from Lascaux are using composite view: horns from the front so both horns are shown, rest of the body in profile.

![Left wall of the Hall of Bulls, Lascaux II \(replica of the original cave, which is closed to the public\), France, original cave: c. 16,000-14,000 BCE. Largest bull 11&apos;6&apos;&apos; long.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

First appearance of man \(as opposed to woman\) in the history of art. Bird-faced, bird staff \(?\), four fingers and one prominent penis:

![Rhinoceros, wounded man, and disemboweled bison, painting in the well of the cave at Lascaux, France, ca. 16,000&#x2013;14,000 BCE. Bison 3&apos; 4 12&quot; long.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)
