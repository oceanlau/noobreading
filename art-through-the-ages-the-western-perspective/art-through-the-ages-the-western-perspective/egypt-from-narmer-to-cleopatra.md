# Egypt from Narmer to Cleopatra

Egypt in predynastic periood was divided into Upper Egypt and Southern Egypt. Note that the upper means Niles upstream so it is the southern part in a modern map.

Above is an interesting mural painting from Upper Egypt. Below it's the Palette of King Narmer. This is one of the earliest historical \(versus prehistorical\) artworks according to the book. The palette is used to prepare eye makeup which Egyptians used to protect their eyes against sun glare. It probably depicts unification of two kingdoms but in reality this unification might not be a single event.
