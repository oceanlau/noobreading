# Ancient Mesopotamia and Persia

Mesopotamia, greek name for "the land between rivers \(Tigris and Euphrates\)", is where the funadamental change in the nature of our daily lives first occurred. Often called the Fertile Crescent, Mesopotamia is the presumed locale of the biblical Garden of Eden \(Gen. 2.10–15\).

## Sumer

3500-2332 BCE

Ancient Sumer, which roughly corresponds to southern Iraq today, comprised a dozen or so independent city-states under the protection of different Mesopotamian deities.

Two great inventions of Sumerians are city-state, which are ruled by a single person or a council, and writing, from early pictographs to later more abstract cuneiform signs. The Sumerians also produced great literature. Their most famous work, known from fragmentary cuneiform texts, is the late-third-millennium bce Epic of Gilgamesh, which antedates the Greek poet Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey by some 1,500 years. It recounts the heroic story of Gilgamesh, legendary king of Uruk and slayer of the monster Huwawa.

#### **White Temple and its ziggurat** 

A ziggurat is a built raised platform with four sloping sides—like a chopped-off pyramid. Ziggurats are made of mud-bricks—the building material of choice in the Near East, as stone is rare.

Lots of attention are drawn due to the great discovery of the Royal Cemetery at Ur in southern Iraq, by British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley \(1880–1960\) in the 1920s.

#### **Mask of Wakar**

Marble is rare in Uruk so the stone for this might come at a great cost. There should be a lot of decoration in its original appearance, like a wig at the top of the head and colored shell or stone filling the eyebrows and eyes.

#### Warka Vase

The Sumerians were probably the first to use pictures to tell coherent stories. This vase depicts a religious ceremony.

#### Eshnunna Statuettes

The inlaid oversized eyes and the tiny hands, which represents a conscious decision on the part of the sculptors to vary the size of the parts of the body—a kind of hierarchy of scale within a single figure complementing the hierarchy of scale among figures in a group. Perhaps the purpose of these votive figures was to offer constant prayers to the gods on their donors’ behalf, the open-eyed stares most likely symbolize the eternal wakeful- ness necessary to fulfill their duty.

Similar figurines are found at other sites. I hate to admit it but these are my favorites. Aren't they both creepy and cute...

#### Standard of Ur

Two principal roles of a Sumerian ruler—the mighty warrior who defeats enemies of his city-state, and the chief administrator who, with the blessing of the gods, assures the bountifulness of the land in peacetime. Isn't it beautiful.

## Akkad

2332-2150 BCE

Sumer cities got dominated by a great ruler, Sargon of Akkad \(r. 2332–2279 BCE\). The Akkadians were Semitic in origin.

#### Akkadian Portraiture

It was originally the head of a statue that was knocked over, perhaps when the Medes, a people that occupied the land south of the Caspian Sea, sacked the city in 612 BCE. But the damage to the portrait was not the result solely of the statue’s toppling. There are also signs of deliberate mutilation. To make a political statement, the attackers gouged out the eyes \(once inlaid with precious or semiprecious stones\), broke off the lower part of the beard, and slashed the ears of the royal portrait. What a pity.

#### Naram-sin Stele

The stele commemorates the Akkadian ruler’s defeat of the Lullubi, a people of the Iranian mountains to the east. It carries two inscriptions, one in honor of Naram-Sin and one naming the Elamite king who captured Sippar in 1157 BCE and took the stele as booty back to Susa in southwestern Iran, the stele’s findspot.

The sculptor depicted Naram-Sin leading his army up the slopes of a wooded mountain. His routed enemies fall, flee, die, or beg for mercy. The king stands alone, far taller than his men, tread- ing on the bodies of two of the fallen Lullubi. He wears the horned helmet signifying divinity—the first time a king appears as a god in Mesopotamian art. At least three favorable stars \(the stele is damaged at the top\) shine on his triumph.

The sculptor showed daring innovation in creating a landscape setting for the story and placing the figures on successive levels within that landscape. Among extant Mesopotamian works, this is the first time an artist rejected the standard format of telling a story in a series of horizontal registers, the compositional formula that had been the rule for a millennium.

## Neo-Sumerian and Babylonian

2150-1600 BCE

Around 2150 bce, a mountain people, the Gutians, brought an end to Akkadian power. The cities of Sumer, however, soon united in response to the alien presence, drove the Gutians out of Mesopotamia, and established a Neo-Sumerian state ruled by the kings of Ur. Historians call this period the Neo- Sumerian age or the Third Dynasty of Ur.

#### Gudea of Lagash

Nearly two dozen of Gudea, the ensi \(ruler\) of Lagash around 2100 BCE survived. The inscription of this figure emphasis that it is built from diorite, a precious material that had to be imported from present-day Oman. And it is extremely hard to carve.

#### Hammurabi’s Laws

At the top is a representation in high relief of Hammurabi in the presence of Shamash, the flame-shouldered sun god. The king raises his hand in respect. The god extends to Hammurabi the rod and ring that symbolize authority. The symbols are builders’ tools—measuring rods and coiled rope. They connote the ruler’s capacity to build the social order and to mea- sure people’s lives—that is, to render judgments and enforce the laws spelled out on the stele. The collection of Hammurabi’s judicial pronouncements is inscribed on the Susa stele in Akkadian in 3,500 lines of cuneiform characters.

## Hittite and Assyrian

1600-612 BCE

## Neo-Babylonian and Achaeminid
