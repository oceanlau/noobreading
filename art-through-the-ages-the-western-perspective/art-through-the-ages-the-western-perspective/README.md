# Art Through the Ages - The Western Perspective

This is my notes reading the classic art history textbook. I have selected some works that are most interesting to me or absolutely pivotal. I don't study art so I'll focus on the history part instead of the art part. I gather all the pictures from the Internet and I'll try to give credits to the sources.
